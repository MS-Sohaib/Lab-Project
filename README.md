## Vulnerability Overview
### What is Command Injection?
An attack method where attackers execute arbitrary commands on systems by injecting malicious code into command-line scripts or applications.

### How the Vulnerability Arises
- **Common scenarios:** Improper input validation, handling of user inputs, and misuse of system commands.
- **System trust:** Over-reliance on user inputs can lead to exploitable vulnerabilities.

---

## Exploitation Process
### How Does it Work?
1. **Attacker Input:** Malicious commands are inserted via input fields.
2. **System Execution:** The system, without proper validation, executes these commands.
3. **Outcome:** Malicious actions, such as data theft or system compromise, occur.

### How Command Injection is Exploited
1. **Identifying Vulnerable Points:** 
   - Target Inputs
   - Analyzing Code
2. **Crafting Malicious Inputs:** 
   - Basic Injection
   - Payloads
3. **Exploitation Techniques:** 
   - Testing for Blind Injection (Trial and Error, Automated Tools)
   - Executing Commands (System Commands, Privilege Escalation)
   - Covering Tracks (Minimizing Detection, Logging Evasion)

## Tools & Demonstrations
### Popular Tools Overview
- **Commix:** Automated detection, custom payloads, interactive shell, multi-platform support.
- **Burp Suite:** Proxy tool, web vulnerability scanner.
- **OWASP ZAP:** Active & passive scanning, interactive proxy, scripting support.
- **Metasploit:** Exploit modules, post-exploitation modules, community-driven exploits.

---

## Mitigation Strategies
### Proactive Measures - Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Validation:** Ensure inputs meet specific criteria.
- **Sanitization:** Clean inputs to neutralize malicious content.

### Proactive Measures - Whitelisting Inputs
- **Definition:** Allow only known, pre-approved inputs.
- **Implementation:** Regular updates and reviews of the whitelist.

### Proactive Measures - Regular Audits & Monitoring
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Scan systems regularly for vulnerabilities.
- **Benefits:** Early detection leads to timely responses and reduced risks.

### Proactive Measures - Least Privilege Principle
- **Definition:** Limit access to only necessary permissions.
- **Implementation:** Regular reviews of permissions and access levels.

### Proactive Measures - Using Safe APIs
- **Transition:** Move from direct command execution to using safer APIs.
- **Benefits:** Enhanced security, improved error handling.
